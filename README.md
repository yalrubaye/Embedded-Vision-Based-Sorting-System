# Technologies: C, STM32 Microcontroller, Raspberry Pi, UART, PWM, I2C, ADC

# A vision-driven embedded system designed to automate object sorting based on color, reducing labor costs and human error in industrial settings. Ideal for applications in manufacturing and assembly lines, such as separating resistors, wires, or plastic components by color. Achieved over 85% accuracy in real-time detection and sorting using color sensors, microcontroller interfacing, and Raspberry Pi processing.
