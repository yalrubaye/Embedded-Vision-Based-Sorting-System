# Embedded-Vision-Based-Sorting-System  
A vision-driven embedded system designed to automate object sorting based on color, reducing labor costs and human error in industrial settings. Ideal for applications in manufacturing and assembly lines, such as separating resistors, wires, or plastic components by color. Achieved over 85% accuracy in real-time detection and sorting using color sensors and microcontroller interfacing.  
## Technologies  
C, STM32 Microcontroller, MobaXterm, UART, PWM, ICM, ADC  
## Note  
This is a large project developed using the STM32L432KC microcontroller and STM32CubeIDE. If youâ€™re unfamiliar with STM32CubeIDE, it automatically generates project files after you configure your settings.
The main application logic is written in main.c.
For reference, see the images/ folder for screenshots of the project settings and configurations.

## See It in Action  
Check out the results/ folder, it contains images of the system actively detecting and sorting objects by color in real-time. It's visual proof of the project achieving over 85% sorting accuracy with embedded automation
