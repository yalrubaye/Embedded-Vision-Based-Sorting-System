# Embedded-Vision-Based-Sorting-System

Technologies: C, STM32 Microcontroller, Raspberry Pi, UART, PWM, I2C, ADC

A vision-driven embedded system designed to automate object sorting based on color, reducing labor costs and human error in industrial settings. Ideal for applications in manufacturing and assembly lines, such as separating resistors, wires, or plastic components by color. Achieved over 85% accuracy in real-time detection and sorting using color sensors, microcontroller interfacing, and Raspberry Pi processing.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
This is a large project developed using the STM32L432KC microcontroller and STM32CubeIDE. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with STM32CubeIDE, it automatically generates project files after you configure your settings.
The main application logic is written in main.c.
For reference, see the images/ folder for screenshots of the project settings and configurations.
